# -Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Build a Tic Tac Toe game with Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

Quickstart
There are two examples in this repository that show how the /original project could be refactored using different libraries and patterns. I suggest reading through them in the following order.

Vanilla Refactor - this is the closest representation of the original project and I highly recommend starting here since the remaining examples build off of the patterns here. You can also view the typescript Git branch to see how this would look written in TS rather than JS.
React Refactor - this shows a React implementation of the project, which is a much more declarative approach than the vanilla implementations, which are mostly imperative. See my post on declarative vs. imperative programming. This also has a TypeScript implementation on the typescript branch.
